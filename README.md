# ReachabilityAnalysis

Demonstrates the Reachability-analysis for POIs in Munich based on the m:n-matrix-calculation from HERE-API.

To install the app you need a webcontainer that is able to host JAVA-classes (even though the app currently does not contain any, so you could even use a webserver such Apache Web Server). Simply install the war-file from the link beyond into your server and then call myserver:myPort/SpringMVC4
